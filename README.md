AudioVideoMerger is a tool for painlessly replacing audio under video files.

- **Fast**: No re-encoding of the video.
- **Simple to use**: Drag 'n drop files onto the app's icon or in the UI.
- **Easy to install**: Uses `ffmpeg` and has it bundled so no need to manually install dependencies.
- **Process multiple files at once**: Select as many audio and video files you want: AudioVideoMerger will automatically create versions for each combination.

## Platforms

Runs on macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher.
