AudioVideoMerger is a tool for painlessly replacing audio under video files.

- **Fast**: No re-encoding of the video.
- **Simple to use**: Drag 'n drop files onto the app's icon or in the UI.
- **Easy to install**: Uses `ffmpeg` and has it bundled so no need to manually install dependencies.
- **Process multiple files at once**: Select as many audio and video files you want: AudioVideoMerger will automatically create versions for each combination.

## Why? ü§®

I work in audio for video and we (and our clients) constantly put new versions of audio under a video, sometimes wanting to test many different audio tracks for the same video. Creating a new video every time is a hassle, especially in a video editor. This app is built to handle exactly that, in seconds, without the need to re-render, and by bundling `ffmpeg` we can now easily share it. It works exactly how we like it to work, and therefore is deliberately kept simple. <sub>(But feel free to [post an issue](https://github.com/kapoko/audio-video-merger/issues) if you have a suggestion on making this app fit more use cases!)</sub>

## Platforms üíª

Runs on macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher.
